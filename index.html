                    <p class="content-para">Well hackers are able to hack you, because of mistakes you make. According to Cybintsolutions.com, “95% of cybersecurity breaches are caused by human error”. One example could be an employee posting a picture of themself working at their desk on their LinkedIn profile. This may provide a hacker with numerous clues, such as what is the make and model of their computer (to try and search for vulnerabilities), or maybe what current project they are working on (to try and social engineer some information from them). To a hacker, any piece of information is valuable.</p>

                        <li>Hackers often look for easy targets that likely think that they won’t ever be hacked. This is because such people often let down their guard and tend to have weaker passwords or less security features enabled.?</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Be honest, would you be tempted to pick up a usb drive lying on the ground if it had the label 512 GB on it. I know I would, but knowing what I know, and having practiced and applied it, I would definitely not pick it up. Often even if people are aware of these risks, they still end up making the same mistakes, which means that these ideas are not used in practice.</li>
